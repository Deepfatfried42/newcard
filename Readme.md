# Hi-Lo

    Is a game in which the player guesses if the next card drawn by the dealer will be higher or lower than the previous one. Points are won or lost based on whether or not the player guessed correctly.

## Rules

    In Hi-Lo a player starts the game with 300 points. The cards are represented as 1 - 13. The first card is displayed then from that point the player enters in if the card will be higher or lower than the card shown. If the card was correctly guess you gain 100 points.  If the card was incorrectly guessed you lose 75 points. If you reach 0 points the game is over. The game can also be over if you decide not to keep playing.
